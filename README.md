🚀 About Me

I am a project-oriented MERN developer focused on building secure, scalable, and well-structured applications.

My primary interest lies in backend development — designing authentication systems, implementing role-based access control, modeling databases efficiently, and maintaining clean architecture with clear separation of concerns.

Currently focused on strengthening my backend expertise while improving DSA and system design fundamentals.
